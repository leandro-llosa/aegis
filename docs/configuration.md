# Configuration

Aegis is configured by a single file: `.aegis.yaml`. It is **declarative
YAML**, parsed once at startup. Two sections are required: `agents:`
(profile name → agent spec) and `default_agent:` (which key in
`agents:` to use when no `--agent` is specified). Queues, Telegram,
schedules, remotes, groups, and workflow plugins are optional.

Two paths to author the file:

- **Interactive (TUI ConfigPanel).** Launch `aegis` in any directory.
  With no `.aegis.yaml` present, the TUI drops you straight into the
  ConfigPanel; press `a` to add an agent, save, and you're ready.
  Reach the same panel mid-session via `F2`.
- **Scriptable (CLI).** `aegis config agent add <slug> --provider …
  --model …` writes the same file. See [CLI surface](#cli-surface)
  below for the full set of verbs.

The rest of this page is the reference for what each section means.

## Search

`aegis` walks up from the current directory and uses the closest
ancestor containing a `.aegis.yaml`. With no `.aegis.yaml` anywhere,
`aegis` launches the TUI ConfigPanel so you can create one in place.

## Agents

```yaml
default_agent: default
agents:
  default:
    provider: claude-code
    model: opus
    effort: high
    permission: auto
  fast:
    provider: gemini
    model: gemini-3-flash-preview
    permission: full
  oss:
    provider: opencode
    model: opencode/kimi-k2.6
    permission: full
```

### Providers

Each agent's `provider:` selects which CLI aegis drives.

| Provider value | Driver | Fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | Claude Code  | `model`, `effort`, `permission` | The only provider with an `effort` knob. |
| `gemini`      | Gemini CLI   | `model`, `permission` | Permission maps to `--approval-mode`. |
| `opencode`    | OpenCode     | `model`, `permission` | Model strings use `provider/model` form. |
| `lovelaice`   | Lovelaice    | `model`, `permission`, `base_url`, `api_key_file` | The native agent — a dependency, not a CLI you install. `permission` defaults to `full`. |
| `codex`       | Codex        | `model`, `permission` | Via the `codex-acp` adapter; needs `codex login`. |
| `prime-agent` | Prime Agent  | `model`, `permission` | Native `--mode acp`. |

See [Drivers](drivers.md) for what each provider's `model` strings
look like and how permission maps to the underlying CLI's flag.

### `harnesses` (optional)

A `provider:` block names a driver and carries that agent's credentials
inline. `harnesses:` lifts the same fields into a **named, top-level
entry** so several agents can share one endpoint, and so the same driver
can be registered twice against different endpoints:

```yaml
harnesses:
  openrouter:
    driver: lovelaice
    base_url: https://openrouter.ai/api/v1
    api_key_file: ~/.config/aegis/openrouter.token
    default_model: anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5
  ollama:
    driver: lovelaice
    base_url: http://localhost:11434/v1

agents:
  cheap:
    harness: openrouter        # inherits base_url + key + default_model
  local:
    harness: ollama
    model: qwen3:8b            # an agent's own model wins
```

| Field | Required | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `driver` | yes | one of `claude-code`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `lovelaice`, `codex`, `prime-agent`. An unknown driver fails loud at boot. |
| `base_url` | no | endpoint the driver talks to |
| `api_key_file` | no | path to a file holding the key, read at spawn. Never inline a key. |
| `default_model` | no | model for agents that don't set their own |
| `permission_default` | no | [permission](#permission) for agents that don't set their own |

The driver names **auto-register as implicit harnesses**, so
`harness: claude-code` works with no `harnesses:` block at all and every
existing `provider:` config keeps loading unchanged. An explicit entry
wins over the implicit one of the same name. Resolution rewrites an
agent's `harness` to the underlying driver string, so an agent ends up
with exactly the same shape either way.

### Permission

`permission:` is one of `read`, `write`, `full`, `auto`.

| Value | Claude | Gemini | OpenCode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `read`  | plan-mode | `--approval-mode plan`      | read-only tools |
| `write` | edit-mode | `--approval-mode auto_edit` | edit tools |
| `full`  | bypass    | `--approval-mode yolo`      | unrestricted |
| `auto`  | default   | `--approval-mode default`   | default |

The ACP harnesses (gemini, opencode, codex, prime-agent, lovelaice) take no
permission flag: aegis's ACP client auto-allows the first permission option
the harness offers.

### Effort (Claude only)

`effort:` is one of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `max`. Other providers
ignore it.

### `text_generation` (optional)

Top-level. Names an agent profile whose harness + model handles aegis's own
small one-shot calls — the `/btw` side note, and anything else that reaches
the [`generate()` seam](drivers.md#one-shot-generation). These are throwaway
calls with no session, no MCP and no tools, so they belong on something cheap:

```yaml
text_generation: haiku
```

The value must name an entry in `agents:`; an unknown slug is fail-loud at
boot. Unset, a one-shot call bills at the *session's* own model, and aegis
says so once per session rather than quietly charging Opus rates for a side
question.

### `recap` and `loop_judge` (optional)

Top-level booleans, **both default `true`**. They are the two automatic
consumers of the `generate()` seam, so both bill to `text_generation:` —
which is the reason to set it: measured, one call is $0.045 on haiku against
$0.32–$0.46 on Opus.

```yaml
recap: true          # one-line recap after every turn; drawn only when it moved the substrate
loop_judge: true     # decide whether an armed /loop continues
```

`recap:` also gates the automatic line, not `/recap` — the command stays
available either way. Turning `loop_judge:` off returns `/loop` to running
to its iteration cap unless the operator stops it.

### `fleet` (optional)

Top-level mapping for the mid-turn recap: the `now …` line on a working
session's F10 card and in its F3 sidebar. It is the third automatic
consumer of the `generate()` seam and bills to `text_generation:` like the
other two. Measured on a real 61-turn transcript on haiku, one call costs
**~$0.007–0.015** at list price, against the subscription pool.

```yaml
fleet:
  recap: watched         # watched | off
  recap_after_s: 60      # a turn must have run this long before its first call
  recap_interval_s: 120  # at least this long between calls; floor 30
```

- `watched` (the default) pays only for sessions a client has on screen:
  the active tab while F3 is open, and every session while F10 is open. A
  background tab, a closed sidebar or a detached client pays nothing.
- `off` never calls; the cards and the sidebar show no `now` line.

The call bills only to [`text_generation:`](#text_generation-optional). When
that key is unset or names no profile, the recap is refused rather than
billed to the session's own model, the card shows no `now` line, and the
daemon log says why once per session.

There is no mode that pays for sessions nobody has on screen, and
`recap: on` is refused at boot. `aegis dash` on a second monitor counts as
watching, so a fleet you want recapped all day is one `aegis dash` away.

`recap_interval_s` below 30 is refused at boot: a call takes about 5 s, so a
shorter interval buys lines faster than anyone reads a card. Both durations
must be whole seconds. The F10 band shows what these calls have cost the open
sessions, as `recap $X / N calls`, and adds `· C cancelled` when a call was
killed before its price printed.

## Drop-in overlays

Each top-level section also accepts overlay files under
`.aegis/{agents,queues,schedules,groups,remotes}/<name>.yaml`. The
file body **is** the entry (no extra `name:` wrapper); the filename
stem is the entry key.

```
.aegis/
  agents/
    sonnet.yaml         # body: provider:, model:, ...
  schedules/
    nightly.yaml        # body: workflow:, cron:, ...
```

Inline + overlay key collisions are fail-loud at boot.

## Queues

Optional. Static configuration for the queue substrate; see
[Queues](queues.md) for the runtime model.

```yaml
queues:
  review:
    agent: fast
    max_parallel: 2
  research:
    agent: default
    max_parallel: 1
```

Each queue binds to one agent profile and a `max_parallel` cap. An
agent can then call `aegis_enqueue(queue="review", payload=...)` and
the substrate spawns a worker of that profile to run the payload.
Validation is fail-loud at boot: unknown agent refs or non-positive
caps cause `aegis` to abort with a clear error.

### Budgets (optional)

Add a `budgets:` list to cap rolling USD spend or output-token volume
on a queue. All entries must allow for the enqueue to be admitted:

```yaml
queues:
  impl:
    agent: opus
    max_parallel: 2
    budgets:
      - usd: 1.00
        window: 1h
      - usd: 10.00
        window: 24h
      - output_tokens: 500000
        window: 1h
      - usd: 50.00
        window: 7d
  fast:
    agent: haiku-fast
    max_parallel: 4
    # no budgets: key → no caps
```

Each entry carries exactly one constraint (`usd` or `output_tokens`)
and a `window` string (`30m`, `1h`, `5h`, `24h`, `7d`, `1w`, `30d`).
When a queue exceeds any budget, new enqueues are rejected with a
structured error naming every blocking constraint and an `unblock_at`
ETA. See [Budgets](budget.md) for the full model, rejection shape, and
observability surface.

## Voice input (push-to-talk)

Optional, off by default. Install the extra: `pip install aegis-harness[voice]`
(base `harpio` + `sounddevice`; NOT `harpio[cli]`). `sounddevice` needs the
system PortAudio library — on Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libportaudio2`.

Enable per project in `.aegis.yaml`:

```yaml
voice:
  enabled: true
  model: base        # tiny | base | small | medium | large-v3
  key: ctrl+g        # Textual binding string
  language: null     # e.g. "en", "es"; null autodetects
```

Press the key (default `ctrl+g`) to start recording into the focused pane's
input; press again — from any tab — to stop. On stop, the whole utterance is
transcribed at once (record-then-transcribe) and inserted at the input. Text is
never auto-sent: edit and press Enter. One recording at a time, and it stays
anchored to the input it started on even if you switch tabs. Transcription is
fully on-device (via [harp](https://github.com/apiad/harp)). If the extra isn't
installed, the key shows an install hint instead of recording.

## Headless / Telegram

```yaml
telegram:
  token: "..."            # or set AEGIS_TELEGRAM_TOKEN (env wins)
  chat_id: 123456         # the single allowed chat
  # auto_prompt: ""       # set to "" to disable the default brevity hint
```

Run with:

```bash
aegis serve
```

See [Telegram](telegram.md) for the full command surface, setup,
output examples, `@<peer>` cross-host syntax, and FAQ.

A systemd unit template lives at `scripts/aegis-serve.service`.

## Groups

Optional. Declarative shapes for agent committees:

```yaml
groups:
  defaults:
    broadcast_timeout: 300
    default_reducer: join_by_handle
  presets:
    code_audit:
      profiles: [sec, style, logic]
```

Per-preset overlays live at `.aegis/groups/<name>.yaml` (file body is
the preset body — `profiles: [...]` directly). Inline + overlay
collisions on a preset name are fail-loud.

Presets become callable via the MCP plane:

```
aegis_group_spawn_mixed(group="rev", preset="code_audit")
```

See [Groups](groups.md) for the full surface.

## Workflows

`@workflow`-decorated functions are auto-discovered. At boot, aegis
imports every `*.py` under each `plugin_dirs:` entry (default
`.aegis/plugins/`):

```yaml
plugin_dirs:
  - .aegis/plugins
  - my_workflows
```

Drop your workflow modules into any listed folder; the `@workflow`
decorator fires at import time and the name lands in the registry.
See [Workflows](workflows.md) for writing your own.

To enable one of aegis's built-in workflow modules (under
`aegis.workflows.builtins.*`), name it in `workflows:`:

```yaml
workflows:
  - my_builtin
```

A **dynamic** workflow — one an agent composes at call time rather than
one you wrote — is gated on how many agents its plan projects:

```yaml
dynamic_workflow_autoapprove_agents: 5     # the default
```

At or under the threshold the plan runs; above it, the call returns
`status: gated` with the rendered plan and its projected agent count, for
a human to approve. Set it to `0` to review every dynamic workflow. The
gate applies to **agents** only: a workflow you invoke yourself from the
operator input is always auto-approved, whatever the number.

## Schedules

Optional. Fires a registered workflow on a cron expression or at a single
future instant.

```yaml
schedules:
  nightly-digest:
    workflow: prompt              # must be a registered workflow name
    cron: "0 3 * * *"             # standard 5-field cron
    timezone: America/Havana      # IANA name; defaults to UTC
    lifecycle: forever
    args:
      prompt: summarise what landed today
```

| Field | Required | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow` | yes | a registered workflow. An unknown name fails loud. |
| `cron` | one of | 5-field cron expression |
| `fire_at` | one of | a single ISO-8601 instant, instead of `cron` |
| `timezone` | no | IANA name the `cron` is interpreted in; defaults to UTC |
| `args` | no | mapping passed to the workflow |
| `lifecycle` | no | `forever` (default), `once`, `{fires: N}`, or `{until: <ISO>}` |
| `enabled` | no | `false` parks an entry without deleting it; defaults to `true` |
| `on_overlap` | no | what to do when a fire lands while the last one is still running: `skip` (default), `queue`, or `kill` |

A schedule must carry exactly one of `cron` or `fire_at`; neither is a
config error. Like agents and queues, schedules also accept [drop-in
overlays](#drop-in-overlays) at `.aegis/schedules/<name>.yaml`, and
agents can push new ones at runtime — see `/schedules` in
[Slash commands](commands.md).

One rule worth knowing before you write one: a scheduled `enqueue`
workflow may not set `callback: true`. The scheduler has no inbox for the
reply to land in, so aegis refuses the spec rather than dropping the
result silently.

## Web UI

Optional. `aegis web` and `aegis serve` both serve the installable PWA;
this block configures it.

```yaml
web:
  token: "..."          # or set AEGIS_WEB_TOKEN (env wins)
  bind: 127.0.0.1       # the default; 0.0.0.0 to expose on the LAN
  port: 8900            # omit to reuse the last port, else pick a free one
```

| Field | Means |
|---|---|
| `token` | shared secret every client must present. `AEGIS_WEB_TOKEN` overrides the file. |
| `bind` | interface to listen on. Defaults to `127.0.0.1` — loopback only. |
| `port` | fixed port. Omitted, aegis reuses the port recorded in `.aegis/state/web.port`, and failing that asks the OS for a free one and records it. |

**`aegis serve` starts the web frontend only when a token is set.** A
`web:` block without `token` is treated as absent, because binding an
unauthenticated agent-control surface is never what someone meant. The
same token is what `--remote ws://…` needs — see [Remote plane](remote.md).

## Execution hosts

Optional. Declares machines an agent's harness can run on, over a
persistent SSH connection. The session, tab and transcript stay local;
only the subprocess is elsewhere. Full guide: [Execution
hosts](hosts.md).

```yaml
hosts:
  vps:
    ssh: vps.apiad.net          # handed to ssh verbatim — ~/.ssh/config applies
    cwd: /home/apiad/Workspace  # default working tree there
  smaug:
    ssh: smaug.local
    cwd: /home/apiad/work
    ssh_opts: ["-o", "ServerAliveInterval=15"]
    login_shell: true           # default; see below
```

| key | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ssh` | yes | ssh destination — an alias from `~/.ssh/config` works, as do `ProxyCommand` and jump hosts |
| `cwd` | yes | default working directory on that machine |
| `ssh_opts` | no | extra flags appended to every ssh invocation for this host |
| `login_shell` | no (`true`) | run the harness under `bash -lc`. Leave it on: a non-interactive ssh command does not source your profile, so a harness in `~/.local/bin` would not be on `PATH`. |
| `remote_mcp_port` | no | pin the remote end of the MCP tunnel instead of letting sshd allocate one |

`local` is implicit and cannot be declared. Overlays live at
`.aegis/hosts/<name>.yaml`. An agent profile may name a default host:

```yaml
agents:
  deploy:
    harness: claude-code
    model: opus
    host: vps
```

Scriptable equivalents: `aegis config host add|list|remove`.

## Remote plane

!!! note "Not the same thing as [execution hosts](hosts.md)"
    The remote plane federates **two aegises**. Execution hosts keep one
    local aegis and move only the harness process. See the
    [disambiguation table](hosts.md#this-is-not-remote-and-not-the-remote-plane).

Optional. Lets this `aegis serve` enqueue work into another `aegis
serve` over HTTP and/or accept incoming enqueues from peers on the
same tailnet.

**Outbound** — the list of remotes this serve can call:

```yaml
remotes:
  vps:
    url: http://100.64.0.5:8556
    token: "<optional bearer>"      # if the peer requires auth
    peer_name: zion                 # how the peer knows *us*
```

Per-remote overlay files at `.aegis/remotes/<name>.yaml` (body is the
remote body — `url:` directly). Name collisions between inline and
overlay are fail-loud.

`peer_name` is the name this caller goes by in the *peer's*
`remotes:` block. It's used as the `callback_to` value when calling
`aegis_enqueue(target="<peer>", callback=True)` — the peer will then
look that name up in its own outbound remotes to route the callback
back. Required for callback delivery; ignored for fire-and-forget
enqueues.

**Inbound** — opt-in section that turns on the receive side:

```yaml
remote_plane:
  bind: 100.64.0.5:8556         # tailnet IP, explicit
  peer_name: zion               # this serve's own name (see below)
  accept_tokens: []             # optional bearer-token allowlist
  accept_from: []               # optional source-IP allowlist
```

`peer_name` is **this serve's identity** as seen by its peers. It
populates the `from_peer` field of outbound callback POSTs so the
receiver can match it against its own `remotes:` map. Required when
this serve also has `remotes:` configured (i.e. might send callbacks);
receiver-only deployments may leave it unset.

Convention: the `peer_name` here must equal the value you use in
every peer's `remotes.<this-serve>.peer_name` — it's the single
identity by which the rest of the tailnet knows you. If `remotes:` is
set but `remote_plane.peer_name` is not, the serve still boots but
the outbound callback observer is not installed; any
`aegis_enqueue(target=…, callback=True)` then returns a loud error
at call time. Fire-and-forget enqueues continue to work unchanged.

Default off (key absent or empty block). Gates compose with AND — both
empty means "anything that reaches the port is trusted." See
[Remote plane](remote.md) for the full surface, error model, and
patterns.

## CLI surface

Every section above is also reachable through `aegis config`:

```
aegis config show [--json]
aegis config agent list / add <slug> --provider --model [--effort] [--permission] / remove <slug>
aegis config queue list / add <name> --agent --max-parallel [--budget …]+ / remove <name>
aegis config host list / add <name> --ssh --cwd [--ssh-opt …]+ [--no-login-shell]
                                    [--remote-mcp-port N] / remove <name>
aegis config telegram show / set [--token --chat-id --auto-prompt
                                  + matching --clear-* variants]
aegis config default-agent <slug>
aegis config plugin-dir list / add <path> / remove <path>
```

Budget spec: `<constraint>:<limit>:<window>`, e.g.
`usd:1.00:1h` or `output_tokens:500000:1h`. The `--budget` flag is
repeatable. Every writing verb validates against the YAML loader's
invariants before persisting; an invalid argument leaves the on-disk
file unchanged.
