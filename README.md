## What aegis is

**Meta-harness.** Most agentic frameworks (CrewAI, LangGraph,
AutoGen, the long list) talk directly to LLM providers — they replace
your coding agent and reimplement tool use, permissions, sandboxing,
terminal integration. Aegis sits *above* your existing coding agents
and drives them over their structured protocols — `stream-json` for
Claude Code, the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) for Gemini CLI and
OpenCode, with a clean driver seam for whatever lands next. The
harness keeps owning tool use, model selection, MCP hosting,
sandboxing. Aegis owns the layer above — tabs, routing, delegation,
persistence — the things a single-conversation CLI was never built to
do.

**Multi-agent.** Six composable coordination primitives, all wired
into one MCP plane every spawned agent sees. **Inbox** for
fire-and-forget context handoff. **Queue** for spawn-a-worker-on-
demand dispatch. **Canvas** for shared markdown blackboards.
**Terminal** for live shared PTYs. **Groups** for broadcast-and-
gather across a committee. **Workflow** for deterministic Python
orchestration. Mix providers freely — a Claude tab hands off to a
Gemini tab; an OpenCode worker drops its result in your inbox; three
agents co-author a canvas; a workflow drives all of them in lockstep.

**Programmable.** The substrate is scriptable from the outside *and*
the inside. Outside: `@workflow`-decorated Python functions that
compose the six primitives into deterministic procedures (TDD loops,
branch reviews, spec-to-plan-to-implementation pipelines), cron-
scheduled or invoked on demand. Inside: spawned agents can mutate
`.aegis.yaml` themselves through MCP — declare a new specialised
agent profile, register a queue, drop a plugin dir, and dispatch work
to it in the same session, no restart. The substrate extends from
inside.

## Six primitives for agent coordination

*— the multi-agent pillar.*

Each primitive has one verb and lands the same way in the receiving
agent's transcript: as a `✉` block with a sender tag, timestamp, and a
short body preview. One delivery channel, six wake patterns.

### `→` Inbox — send context to a peer

Any agent can hand off to any other live agent. Fire-and-forget; the
recipient gets a normal user-message turn tagged with the sender's
handle. Use when you want a *specific* peer to pick up where you left
off.

```python
aegis_handoff(target_handle="reviewer", from_handle="impl",
              context="PR ready at branch feat/x — please review")
# → reviewer's transcript:
#   ✉ from agent:impl · 17:42:03Z
#     PR ready at branch feat/x — please review
```

### `⏳` Queue — spawn a worker on demand

Enqueue a task to a named queue and the substrate spawns a fresh agent
of the queue's configured profile, runs the payload as its opening
turn, and (with `callback=true`) delivers the worker's final result
back to your inbox. Producer keeps working between enqueue and
callback. Generalizes delegation: parallelism, max-in-flight caps,
restart safety, all built in.

```python
aegis_enqueue(queue="review", payload="…full self-contained prompt…",
              from_handle="impl", callback=True)
# → {task_id: 01HK…, queued_position: 1}
# …minutes later, in impl's transcript:
#   ✉ from queue:review · task#01HK… · ok · 17:46:11Z
#     PR looks clean. Two nits flagged in the diff comments…
```

### `▦` Canvas — collaborate on a shared document

Open a shared markdown file. Multiple agents read it, write sections of
it, subscribe to it. Each write wakes every other subscriber with a
diff-aware notification. The classical blackboard pattern — terminal-
native, MCP-driven, file-backed (you can grep it, commit it, open it in
your editor).

```python
# PM
aegis_canvas_open(name="report-q3", file="vault/reports/q3.md",
                  from_handle="pm")
aegis_canvas_subscribe(name="report-q3", from_handle="pm")

# Researcher (in another tab, after a handoff)
aegis_canvas_write_section(name="report-q3", section="data",
                           content="Q3 numbers came in stronger…",
                           from_handle="researcher")
# → PM's transcript:
#   ✉ from canvas:report-q3 · 20:30:00Z
#     section "data" · written by agent:researcher (+18 / -3 lines)
#     ──
#     Q3 numbers came in stronger than projected…
```

### `▮` Terminal — share a live shell

Spawn a PTY-backed shell that any agent (or Alex) can run commands on,
send raw keystrokes to, and subscribe to. Command boundaries are
detected from OSC 133 shell-integration markers; every finalized
command lands in an append-only JSONL ledger and wakes subscribers
through the same `✉` channel.

```python
# PM
aegis_term_spawn(name="build", from_handle="pm")
aegis_term_subscribe(name="build", from_handle="pm")

# builder (after a handoff)
rec = aegis_term_run(name="build", cmd="pytest -q",
                     from_handle="builder")
# → PM's transcript:
#   ✉ from term:build · 14:03:25Z
#     $ pytest -q  · run by agent:builder
#     exit 0 · 4.20s
#     ──
#     6 passed in 4.18s
```

### `▣` Groups — broadcast and gather

Form a named committee of agents that share one inbox-fanout channel
and one in-flight broadcast slot. Send one structured four-field
question — `objective`, `output_format`, `tool_guidance`,
`boundaries` — collect N parallel answers, reduce them into a single
result. Use when the same question has multiple useful perspectives,
or when you want to *race* providers and keep the fastest.

```python
# spawn three reviewers with different lenses
aegis_group_spawn_mixed(name="audit", from_handle="pm",
    profiles=["sec_reviewer", "style_reviewer", "logic_reviewer"])

aegis_group_broadcast(name="audit",
    objective="audit PR #214 (branch feat/rate-limit)",
    output_format="bullet list, each item severity-tagged (high/med/low)",
    tool_guidance="prefer Read + Grep; avoid Bash and Edit",
    boundaries="report only — no patches, no commits")

# collect every reply, keyed by reviewer
result = aegis_group_wait_all(name="audit",
                              timeout=300,
                              reducer="join_by_handle")
# → result.reduced = {"sec_reviewer": "…", "style_reviewer": "…",
#                     "logic_reviewer": "…"}
```

Switching to `aegis_group_wait_any` returns on the first reply and (by
default) sends a passive `cancel` envelope to the losers — useful when
the cheapest acceptable answer wins. Built-in reducers: `concat`,
`join_by_handle`, `last_wins`, `majority_vote`; custom reducers
register one function. Groups also have YAML presets in
`.aegis.yaml` (`groups.presets.<name>.profiles: […]`) and a dedicated
TUI tab with Members / Current broadcast / Recent broadcasts panels.

**Reach for it when:** multi-lens code audit, fastest-answer racing,
cross-provider consensus, generate-and-pick (N candidates → one),
role-persona panels (PM / eng / UX react to the same proposal). Full
walk-through in [docs/groups.md](docs/groups.md).

### `⟳` Workflow — deterministic Python orchestration

When the dance has to be **reliable** — TDD loops, bug triage,
multi-step plans, anything where retries with feedback matter — wrap it
in a workflow. Plain Python at the top of the stack. Calls agents, runs
bash predicates, retries with feedback, captures structured output.

```python
@workflow("tdd-cycle")
async def tdd_cycle(engine, *, feature: str) -> str:
    impl = await engine.spawn("implementer")
    await engine.send(impl, f"Write a failing test for: {feature}")
    await engine.bash_predicate(
        f"pytest tests/ -k {feature} 2>&1 | grep -E 'FAIL|ERROR'",
        retry_with="The test should fail because the feature isn't built yet")
    await engine.send(impl, "Now implement it.")
    await engine.bash_predicate(
        f"pytest tests/ -k {feature}",
        retry_with="Tests are still failing. Output:\n{stdout}")
    reviewer = await engine.spawn("reviewer")
    return await engine.send(reviewer, "Final review of branch.")
```

Triggered by any agent: `aegis_run_workflow(name="tdd-cycle",
kwargs={"feature": "rate_limit"})`. Workflows sit at the top of the
stack — they span agents, they own the loop, they're the right tool
when the spec is "follow this exact procedure" rather than "figure
it out."

The `aegis.workflows` package ships four seed workflows registered on
import: `brainstorm_to_spec` (Q/A → spec doc), `execute_plan` (parse
plan → dispatch implementer per task with durable resume),
`review_branch` (parallel reviewer fan-out → report), and `tdd_cycle`
(predicate-driven TDD loop). See [docs/workflows.md](docs/workflows.md).

## What else is in the box

- **Multi-tab TUI.** Generated alliterating handles (`lucid-knuth`,
  `wry-hopper`) for agents, purpose names (`build`, `db`) for terminals.
  State dots, sticky `*`, terminal bell when a backgrounded agent
  finishes. Click any block to copy it.
- **Honest metrics.** True input (incl. cache) with cached %, output,
  tool calls, per-turn and per-session wall-clock. Provisional while
  streaming, exact at turn end. Live `ctx Nk (P%)` segment shows the
  current turn's true input against the model's context window — Opus
  4.x at 1M, Sonnet/Haiku at 200k, Gemini at 1M. **No log scraping
  anywhere.**
- **Queue dashboard.** Always-on one-line strip above the status bar
  shows live per-queue depth and the most recent in-flight worker.
  `F4` expands into a full-screen modal with `QUEUES / IN-FLIGHT /
  QUEUED / RECENT` bands and a live assistant-text tail.
- **Fleet dashboard.** `F10` shows every session as a card: what it
  finished, what it is doing now, its last tool events, plan, repo and
  cost, with a band of fleet-wide counts on top. Queue workers stay on
  screen for a minute after they close. `aegis dash` opens it in a second
  terminal.
- **File browser + viewer.** `Ctrl+O` opens a **FileBrowserTab** — a
  persistent tab, not a modal, so several can coexist. It lists files
  newest-first over a background watchdog index (the common case is
  *open whatever the agent just touched*, which no filename-first
  picker serves), with a typeahead filter that narrows without
  disturbing that order and a `DirectoryTree` sidebar on the right
  under `F3`. Pick a file and the same tab becomes a full editor —
  syntax-highlighted read-only view by default, `e` toggles edit mode,
  `Ctrl+S` saves, `p` previews Markdown, Escape with unsaved edits
  prompts to discard; `b` or Escape returns to the list, on the file
  you were just reading. Agents can drop you into the view via the
  `aegis_view_file` MCP tool, and `Ctrl+click` on a backtick-wrapped
  filename in any agent response opens it directly. `Ctrl+click` on a
  `Read` / `Write` / `Edit` block opens the file that call touched —
  an `Edit` lands on the line the edit began.
- **Config panel.** `F2` opens the live `.aegis.yaml` editor inside
  the TUI — see agents/queues at a glance, add an agent
  through a validated modal. Same edit helpers back the scriptable
  `aegis config` CLI verbs and a parallel MCP surface
  (`aegis_config_add_agent`, `…_add_queue`, `…_add_plugin_dir`,
  `…_set_schedule_enabled`, plus removes and reads), so agents can
  extend the substrate from inside — declare a queue and enqueue to
  it within one session, no restart. Panel, CLI, and MCP all route
  through the same comment-preserving atomic-write path.
- **Session persistence.** `aegis` reopens the last workspace by
  default — agent tabs, terminal tabs, profiles, order, with each
  underlying session genuinely resumed (model memory intact). A tab is
  restored by resuming its harness conversation, so one that never took a
  turn has no id to resume and does not come back. `aegis --clean` opts
  out.
- **Workflow catalog.** `aegis.workflows` ships four ready-to-use
  seeds (`brainstorm_to_spec`, `execute_plan`, `review_branch`,
  `tdd_cycle`); importing them registers. Engine offers `ask_human`,
  explicit `checkpoint` + durable resume, `bash_predicate` retry
  loops, and `parallel` fan-out.
- **A daemon, and clients.** `aegis` boots no brain: a detached
  `aegis serve` holds it and every view, and a terminal attaches over a
  unix socket. Sessions outlive the terminal, several terminals can watch
  one brain, and `Ctrl+Q` detaches. `aegis ls` and `aegis kill` manage
  daemons across roots. Add a `web:` token to drive the same backend from
  an installable, mobile-first web/PWA client (`aegis web`).
- **MCP plane.** Every spawned agent is injected with the aegis MCP
  server: orientation (`aegis_meta`), session listing, handoff, queue
  dispatch, canvas ops, terminal ops, group broadcast/gather, workflow
  invocation. One consistent surface across providers. With
  `--strict-mcp-config`, aegis is the *only* MCP server the spawned
  agent sees.
- **Driver parity.** The canonical event surface unifies what every
  substrate publishes: semantic tool kinds (📖 read / ✏️ edit / ⌬
  execute / 🔎 search / ✻ think / 🌐 fetch) with locations + raw
  inputs, file diffs for edits, plan blocks for `TodoWrite` /
  `AgentPlanUpdate`, mid-turn cost / mode / title telemetry, and
  end-of-turn `stop_reason` / `cost_usd` / per-model attribution.
  Same render code paths for Claude, Gemini, and OpenCode; opencode's
  per-token thought stream coalesces by `message_id` into one block
  per assistant message.
## Plugins — extend aegis without forking

Plugins are how third-party code adds behavior to a session. Three
composable primitive shapes, auto-imported from disk, installable from
anywhere over `gh:` registry URLs:

- **`@hook(event)`** — fires on harness lifecycle events. `pre_turn`
  is the mutator (prepend system text, rewrite the user message,
  block the turn); `post_turn` / `session_start` / `session_end` are
  observers. Composes deterministically; timeout-wrapped per call;
  JSONL-logged.
- **`@tool`** — first-class FastMCP tools the spawned agent can call.
  Schema is auto-generated from type hints + docstring. Reserved
  names (every built-in `aegis_*`) are guarded at registration.
- **`@workflow`** — orchestrated procedures driven by the
  `WorkflowEngine` (delegate, spawn, send/drain, bash, groups). CLI-,
  MCP-, or scheduler-invoked.

A plugin is one directory: a `plugin.toml` manifest, the Python
module(s) holding decorated functions, and optional `_install.py` /
`_uninstall.py` for setup and teardown. The loader recurses and
auto-imports `*.py`, **skipping** anything starting with `_` — so
install scripts coexist with runtime code without colliding.

Install lifecycle:

```bash
aegis plugin install <name> --from gh:owner/repo#plugins/<name>
aegis plugin list / show / update / search / uninstall
```

`--from` accepts `gh:owner/repo[@ref][#path]` (HTTPS `git archive`
fetch) or `file:///abs/path` (local copy). Without `--from`, the
default registry is `gh:apiad/aegis#plugins/`. Installs roll back on
failure; `.aegis/plugins.lock` records the resolved source +
timestamp.

### Two canonical plugins (in this repo)

**`skill-system`** — Claude-Code-style skill selection on any
harness. A `pre_turn` hook injects a numbered menu parsed from
`.aegis/skills/*.md`; a `load_skill(name)` `@tool` pulls the body on
demand. ~100 lines of Python.

```bash
aegis plugin install skill-system --from gh:apiad/aegis#plugins/skill-system
```

**`memory-system`** — Hermes-inspired persistent memory with
periodic dreaming. Per-project `.aegis/memory/` holds a user-edited
`SOUL.md` + `USER.md`, a `MEMORY.md` index over typed entries (`user`
/ `feedback` / `fact` / `reference`), and a `dreams/` log. The
`pre_turn` hook injects the persona bundle on turn 0 and top-K
relevant teasers on later turns. Five `memory_*` `@tool`s let the
agent read/write/search. The `dream` `@workflow` runs a three-stage
consolidate-plus-synthesize pass over the last week of session
transcripts; install asks once whether to schedule it daily at 03:00.
Exercises every substrate primitive (`@hook`, `@tool`, `@workflow`)
end-to-end.

```bash
aegis plugin install memory-system --from gh:apiad/aegis#plugins/memory-system
```

Full protocol reference: [Plugins documentation](https://apiad.github.io/aegis/plugins/).

## Execution hosts — run an agent on another machine

Give aegis an SSH destination and any agent can run *its harness* over
there, while its tab, transcript and peer identity stay here:

```yaml
hosts:
  vps:
    ssh: vps.apiad.net
    cwd: /home/apiad/Workspace
```

```
/spawn main@vps               # or Ctrl+N → host tier
/spawn main@vps:/srv/app      # …in a specific tree
```

The point is not remote *access* — it is that the agent's `Bash`,
`Read`, `Edit` and `Grep` act on **that** machine's filesystem,
natively, instead of one `ssh` invocation per command. One SSH
ControlMaster is shared by every session on a host, and a reverse tunnel
carries the MCP plane back, so the remote agent is an ordinary peer:

```python
# from a local agent — the new peer runs on the VPS
aegis_spawn(agent="main", prompt="Audit the nginx config",
            from_handle="lucid-knuth", host="vps")
# → it can aegis_handoff back to you, join your canvas, and shows up
#   in aegis_list_sessions carrying host="vps"
```

Paths become host-scoped, because `/srv/app/x.py` on two machines is two
different files: `Ctrl+click` on a remote pane copies `vps:/srv/app/x.py`
rather than opening the local one, and file claims don't collide across
hosts. If the link drops, the pane says so instead of looking idle, and
`/reconnect` rebuilds the harness in the same tab with its history.

Not durable by design — for "keep working while the laptop sleeps", run
`aegis serve` on the box and attach with `aegis --remote`.

→ **[Execution hosts](https://apiad.github.io/aegis/hosts/)**

## Remote plane — cross-machine handoff

`aegis serve` can expose a second HTTP plane — distinct from the
loopback MCP plane, bound wherever you want it reachable — that other
`aegis serve` instances POST into. One agent on one machine can hand
a long task off to another without leaving the substrate:

```python
aegis_enqueue(
    queue="implementation",
    payload="Implement the design at <path> with TDD…",
    from_handle="lucid-knuth",
    target="builder",           # ← new — routes to a remote aegis
)
# → {task_id: "01J…", target: "builder",
#    callback_note: "no wire return channel in v1; completion behavior
#                    is whatever the receiving serve is configured to do"}
```

Configuration lives in `.aegis.yaml`. Outbound — the peers this serve
can call:

```yaml
remotes:
  builder:
    url: http://100.64.0.5:8556
    # token: "<optional bearer>"
```

Inbound — opt-in receive side; default off:

```yaml
remote_plane:
  bind: 100.64.0.5:8556         # the address to listen on
  accept_tokens: []             # optional bearer-token allowlist
  accept_from: []               # optional source-IP allowlist
```

Bind the plane wherever it should be reachable from, and only from —
typically a private overlay network (Tailscale/Headscale/WireGuard/
VPN) so the network itself is the trust anchor. Bearer-token and
source-IP gates compose with AND on top. By default the call is
fire-and-forget: the receiving serve runs the worker under its own
config and whatever it does on completion (commit and push, message
through its own bridge, write to a shared folder, nothing) is up to
it.

Since v0.8.0, `aegis_enqueue(target=…, callback=True)` opts in to a
**wire callback** that delivers the remote worker's final message
back to the originating agent's inbox as a normal `✉ from
queue:<peer>:<name>` envelope (symmetric peers config required —
both sides define each other in `remotes:`). A small
`/remote/v1/schedule/*` control plane (with `aegis_schedule_*` MCP
tools and `aegis schedule push --to <peer>` / `--remote <peer>` CLI
verbs) lets one serve push schedules into a peer and inspect or
remove them remotely — useful for self-scheduling future work or
managing a fleet from one host. Full surface, error model, and
patterns in [docs/remote.md](docs/remote.md).

## Per-queue budgets

*— the programmable pillar.*

Declare rolling USD or output-token ceilings on any queue. The
substrate enforces them at enqueue time — if admitting the task would
push the queue over any configured ceiling, the enqueue is rejected
immediately with a structured error that names the blocking constraint
and gives an ETA for when the queue will unblock.

```python
# .aegis.py
queues = {
    "impl": {
        "agent": "opus",
        "max_parallel": 2,
        "budgets": [
            {"usd": 1.00,             "window": "1h"},
            {"usd": 10.00,            "window": "24h"},
            {"output_tokens": 500000, "window": "1h"},   # runaway belt
            {"usd": 50.00,            "window": "7d"},
        ],
    },
    "fast": {
        "agent": "haiku-fast",
        "max_parallel": 4,
        # no budgets: key → no caps; behaves as before
    },
}
```

All-must-allow: a task is admitted only if every budget entry is
under its ceiling. When rejected, the error names every blocking
constraint, how much was spent vs the limit, and an `unblock_at` ETA.

Budget state is visible via `aegis budget list/show` (with `--remote
<peer>` for cross-host), the `aegis_budget_status` MCP tool, and the
read-only `GET /remote/v1/budget` endpoints on the remote plane. No
alerts — observability is pull-only; the rejection at enqueue time is
the only loud signal.

See [docs/budget.md](docs/budget.md) for the full model.

## Scheduled workflows

*— the programmable pillar.*

Aegis runs a cron-style scheduler alongside QueueManager and the inbox
router. Schedules are declared in `.aegis.yaml` and can be split into
drop-in overlays under `.aegis/schedules/<name>.yaml`. Each entry names
a workflow (built-in or registered), a trigger (`cron` or `fire_at`),
a lifecycle (`forever` / `once` / `{fires: N}` / `{until: <iso>}`),
and an overlap policy (`skip` / `queue` / `kill`).

```yaml
# .aegis.yaml
schedules:
  morning-briefing:
    workflow: prompt
    cron: "0 6 * * *"
    timezone: America/Havana
    args: { agent: default, message: "Write today's briefing." }
  ci-watch:
    workflow: enqueue
    cron: "*/5 * * * *"
    lifecycle: forever
    on_overlap: skip
    args: { queue: ci, payload: "Check CI status and report failures." }
```

Two workflows ship in-tree: `prompt` (one-shot agent message) and
`enqueue` (scheduler → queue handoff).

The substrate writes a JSONL audit log per schedule under
`.aegis/state/schedules/<name>.jsonl` plus a derived
`schedules.snapshot.json` for dashboards. On boot it replays each log
to rebuild fire counts and closes any dangling `fire_requested` record
as `failed:interrupted`. Editing `.aegis.yaml` or any overlay file
hot-swaps the schedule table without a restart — entries that didn't
change keep their state.

```bash
aegis schedule list                # current schedules + next fire
aegis schedule show morning-briefing
aegis schedule run morning-briefing   # force-fire once
aegis schedule disable morning-briefing  # comment-preserving YAML edit
aegis schedule logs morning-briefing -n 50
```

## Install

```bash
pip install aegis-harness        # or: uv pip install aegis-harness
```

Requires Python 3.13+ and at least one of: `claude`, `gemini`, or
`opencode` on your `PATH`, signed-in.

## Quickstart

```bash
aegis          # full-screen TUI — first-class UI for local dev
aegis web      # installable PWA — first-class UI for remote (and local) dev
```

aegis has **two co-equal first-class UIs** over one backend: the
full-screen **TUI** for local development, and an installable, mobile-first
**web/PWA** client for remote development over a flaky link (and locally
too). Both render the same transcripts with identical fidelity; sessions
are shared across them. `aegis web` ensures a token, opens your browser,
and serves the client.

With no `.aegis.yaml` in the directory, `aegis` drops you straight
into the TUI ConfigPanel — press `a` to add your first agent and
save. The scriptable equivalent:

```bash
aegis config agent add main --provider claude-code \
                            --model opus --effort high
aegis                       # start the TUI normally
```

`.aegis.yaml` is declarative YAML — edit it by hand or use
`aegis config` verbs (every section reachable: agents, queues,
default-agent, plugin-dir). Mid-session, reach the
ConfigPanel via `F2`.

## Keys

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `Enter` | Send |
| `!cmd` | **Shell escape** — run `cmd` locally, inject its output as your message |
| `/cmd` | **Slash command** — aegis runs it directly (`/help` lists them); never reaches the agent |
| `/loop <instruction>` | Repeat an instruction every turn until the agent calls `aegis_loop_stop` or the cap (default 20) is hit; `/loop stop` or `Esc` cancels |
| `/fork [prompt]` | **Branch this conversation** into a new tab — a worker that already knows. Refused mid-turn; the parent is untouched. ~$1 |
| `/btw <question>` | **A side note that doesn't cost a conversation** — answered from this pane's recent window, never written to the log. Legal mid-turn; `Esc` cancels |
| `/recap` | **Where this session stands** — a task / outcome / next block over the last eight turns, at the level of what is being solved rather than which files changed. The automatic version, the outcome with the task under it, is drawn after any turn that moved something or needs you. Never written to the session log |
| `@handle <question>` | **Ask an idle peer**, from where you're standing. The answer is a real turn in *their* transcript and a transient block in yours; `--cc` also lands it in yours |
| `/usage quota` | Live subscription utilisation for every provider you hold credentials for (Claude, OpenCode Go) — every window, with reset countdowns. The status bar carries the short form (`⧗ cc 5h 9% · wk 65% │ oc 5h 0% · wk 0% · mo 14%`) always, since quota is an account property and the point is to know which rail to launch on. `aegis usage quota` prints the same from a shell |
| `Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+N` | New tab (default agent) / new tab (pick agent) |
| `Ctrl+E` | New terminal tab (`term:<name>`) |
| `Ctrl+W` | Close tab (last → quit) |
| `Ctrl+1`..`9` / `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+←→` | Switch tabs |
| `Ctrl+Shift+←→` | Move the active tab along the bar (or drag it with the mouse) |
| `Ctrl+K` | Toggle terminal-tab input between **run** and **raw** mode |
| `F4` | Open / close the queue dashboard |
| `F10` | Open / close the fleet dashboard: every session as a card |
| `Ctrl+D` | Detach: leave the daemon and its agents running |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit: detach, and stop the daemon if no other client is attached and a client started it |
| `Ctrl+R` | Session history — reopen a prior session (jump / resume / fresh) |
| `Ctrl+O` | New file browser tab — recency list, filter, tree sidebar, editor |
| `F2` | Open the **ConfigPanel** — edit agents/queues/etc. live |
| `Escape` | Interrupt the active turn (or dismiss a modal) |
| `Alt+↑↓` / `Ctrl+↑↓` / `Alt+End` | Read back over the transcript: one line, one message, or straight to the live tail |
| `Click on a block` | Copy that message / tool result to clipboard |
| `Ctrl+Q` | Quit |

A backgrounded tab that finishes shows a `*` and rings the bell.

## Configuration

`.aegis.yaml` is declarative YAML. Author it interactively (the TUI
ConfigPanel — boot-into-panel when no config exists, `F2` mid-session)
or with the scriptable CLI (`aegis config agent add`, `aegis config
queue add`, `aegis config default-agent`, …). Shape:

```yaml
default_agent: default

agents:
  default:
    provider: claude-code
    model: opus
    effort: high
    permission: auto
  reviewer:
    provider: claude-code
    model: sonnet
    permission: read
  fast:
    provider: gemini
    model: gemini-3-flash-preview
    permission: full
  oss:
    provider: opencode
    model: opencode/kimi-k2.6
    permission: full

queues:
  review:
    agent: reviewer
    max_parallel: 2
  fast:
    agent: fast
    max_parallel: 4
```

## The daemon, headless and web

`aegis` is a client. `aegis serve` is the daemon it attaches to, and
running it in a terminal yourself is how you read its output when it will
not start. `aegis attach [--view N]` attaches this terminal to a root's
daemon, and `aegis dash` does the same with the `F10` fleet dashboard
already open, for a second monitor. `aegis ls` lists daemons across roots
and `aegis kill` stops one. A daemon keeps the code it booted with, and reaps itself after 30
minutes with no views and no sessions; `know-how/the-daemon.md` covers
both.

`aegis serve` runs the SessionManager and MCP plane without the TUI; add
a `web:` block to serve the installable, mobile-first web/PWA client and
drive the team from any browser:

```yaml
# .aegis.yaml
web:
  bind: 127.0.0.1          # front with a reverse proxy for remote access
  port: 8899               # omit to auto-pick
  # token: "…"             # or set AEGIS_WEB_TOKEN (env wins) — keeps it out of git
```

`aegis web` ensures a token, opens your browser, and serves. The TUI, the
web client, and (eventually) a remote TUI all speak the same WebSocket
protocol over one backend, so sessions are shared across them. A systemd
unit template lives at `scripts/aegis-serve.service`.

## Embed aegis in your own program

`aegis.embed()` boots the whole brain — SessionManager, queues, inboxes,
canvas, terminals, schedules and the MCP plane — in your process, at a root
you name:

```python
import aegis

async with aegis.embed("/path/to/project") as ae:
    handle = await ae.manager.spawn("impl", opening_prompt="ship the thing")
    ...          # ae.queues, ae.roots, ae.mcp.server
```

It runs in **your** event loop (it never calls `asyncio.run`) and installs
no signal handlers, so the host keeps its own shutdown. Several instances
coexist in one process, each rooted at a different project, with disjoint
state and no config cross-talk — which works because aegis resolves paths
against three explicit roots (`config_root`, `state_root`, `harness_cwd`)
rather than against the process working directory. That directory belongs
to the host.

See [`know-how/embedding-aegis.md`](know-how/embedding-aegis.md) and the
[API reference](https://apiad.github.io/aegis/api/#embedding).

## When something goes wrong: `aegis logs`

Session transcripts record what each *agent* said. `.aegis/state/aegis.log`
records what **aegis itself** did — and the crashes it caught on its way
down, which would otherwise be a traceback printed onto a screen that is
already being torn down.

```bash
aegis logs --crashes    # crash banners and their tracebacks
aegis logs -f           # follow
```

Crash entries carry the tab roster alongside the traceback, and unwrap
exceptions that arrive inside a Textual `WorkerFailed`. Details in
[Usage](https://apiad.github.io/aegis/usage/#the-aegis-log-aegis-logs).

## Troubleshooting: flicker / tearing in the TUI

If the cursor, the working spinner, and scrolling all **flicker or stutter as
if two frame rates are fighting** — and it starts or stops when you **plug in a
monitor, close the laptop lid, or wake from sleep** — this is **not an aegis
bug**. aegis sets no custom render options, and Textual already negotiates the
terminal's synchronized-output (DEC mode 2026) protocol so frames are emitted
atomically. The flicker is one layer
lower: your **terminal emulator's GPU renderer pacing against a display whose
refresh rate just changed**. It affects every TUI (btop, htop, …), not just
aegis, and the fix is a terminal/GPU setting.

Mitigations by terminal:

- **GTK4/VTE terminals — Ptyxis, GNOME Console, Black Box, GNOME Terminal
  (GTK4).** GTK removed its old GL renderer in 4.18; on older iGPUs (e.g. Intel
  HD 5xx / Skylake) the newer GPU renderers desync against the Wayland frame
  clock after a display change. Force the software renderer:

  ```bash
  mkdir -p ~/.config/environment.d
  echo 'GSK_RENDERER=cairo' > ~/.config/environment.d/50-gsk-renderer.conf
  # log out and back in — this must apply to the terminal's own GTK process,
  # not the shell inside it. Reversible: delete the file + re-login.
  ```

  Costs negligible CPU for a terminal. `GSK_RENDERER=gl` is a middle ground
  that keeps GPU accel. Refs:
  [GNOME Discourse](https://discourse.gnome.org/t/question-about-gtk4-glitches-and-gsk-renderer-gl/28295),
  [GTK docs](https://docs.gtk.org/gtk4/running.html).
- **kitty.** Set `sync_to_monitor no` in `kitty.conf` — it stops tying redraws
  to the monitor refresh (the source of mixed-refresh tearing / CPU spikes).
  Ref: [kitty #3154](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/issues/3154).
- **WezTerm.** Try `front_end = "Software"`, or pin `max_fps` to your **lowest**
  monitor's refresh rate — WezTerm has known jitter/adaptive-sync issues on
  mismatched-refresh multi-monitor setups. Refs:
  [max_fps](https://wezterm.org/config/lua/config/max_fps.html),
  [wezterm #2450](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues/2450),
  [#7611](https://github.com/wezterm/wezterm/issues/7611).
- **Alacritty.** No built-in vsync toggle; use the Mesa env knob
  `vblank_mode=0 alacritty` (or `0`/`3` to taste) to change GL sync behaviour.
  Ref: [alacritty #1739](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty/issues/1739).
- **Any terminal.** Keeping the aegis window on a **single** monitor, or setting
  your displays to a **matching** refresh rate, avoids the mismatch that
  triggers it.
